## Setup

### Initialize and deploy the Amplify project

<details>
  <summary>If you've never used amplify before </summary>
    
  1. [Sign up](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) for an AWS account
  2. Install the AWS Amplify cli: 
  ```sh
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
  ```
  3. Configure the Amplify cli
  ```sh

</details>

```bash
$ amplify init

? Enter a name for the environment: dev (or whatever you would like to call this env)
? Choose your default editor: <YOUR_EDITOR_OF_CHOICE>
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Y

$ amplify push

? Are you sure you want to continue? Y
? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API? Y

> We already have the GraphQL code generated for this project, so generating it here is not necessary.

```

### Install & Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Edit GraphQL Schema

1. Open [`amplify/backend/api/nextjswithamplifyts/schema.graphql`](amplify/backend/api/nextjswithamplifyts/schema.graphql) and change what you need to.
2. Run `amplify push`
3. üëç

### Use with new Amplify project

      ? Are you sure you want to continue? Yes
      ? Do you want to generate code for your newly created GraphQL API Yes
      ? Choose the code generation language target typescript
      ? Enter the file name pattern of graphql queries, mutations and subscriptions src/graphql/**/*.ts
      ? Do you want to generate/update all possible GraphQL operations - queries, mutations and subscriptions Yes
      ? Enter maximum statement depth [increase from default if your schema is deeply nested] 2

## The idea behind this example

This repo shows how to build a server rendered web application with NextJS and AWS Amplify.

We use AWS Amplify to generate code and to manage and consume the AWS cloud resources needed for our app.

The NextJS app has dynamic and static routes to demonstrate how to load data on the server based on the incoming request.

Two routes are implemented :

- `/` : A static route that uses getInitialProps to load data from AppSync and renders it on the server (Code in [pages/index.tsx](/pages/index.tsx))

- `/todo/[id]` : A dynamic route that uses getInitialProps and the id from the provided context to load a single todo from AppSync and render it on the server. (Code in [pages/todo/:[id].tsx](/pages/todo/[id].tsx))

You can read more about it [here](https://dev.to/rakannimer/server-side-rendered-real-time-web-app-with-next-js-aws-amplify-graphql-2j49).
